# base cadc-dev-postgresql image

## Expected deployment
This postgresql instance is designed for development support and has a very low level of
security.

## databases
On startup, the following databases are created:
```
cadctest : intended for database library integration tests
content  : intended for web service back end integration tests
```

## users
The following user accounts are created (name : password):
```
caom2 : pw-caom2
invadm : pw-invadm
tapadm : pw-tapadm
tapuser : pw-tapuser
```
These users are available in all databases.

## schemas
The following schemas are created (name : acccount with full permissions):
```
caom2 : caom2
inventory : invadm
tap_schema : tapadm
tap_upload : tapuser
uws : tapadm
```
These schemas are available in all databases. The first two (caom2 and inventory) are 
for specific content; it would be feasible to have a single "content" user and schema and run 
separate servers instead... or to have a config file read on startup with a list of schema(s)
to create... TBD.

## building it
docker build -t cadc-postgresql-dev -f Dockerfile .

## checking it
docker run -it cadc-postgresql-dev:latest /bin/bash

## running it
docker run -d --volume=/path/to/external/logs:/logs:rw --name pgdev cadc-postgresql-dev:latest

One can expose the postgres server port (-p {external http port}:5432) or access it from an application 
on the same host via the private IP address.
